In Next.js, an uncommon error arises when using the `getStaticProps` or `getStaticPaths` functions with dynamic routes.  If these functions throw an error during build time, Next.js might not handle it gracefully, leading to a silent failure.  The build might seemingly complete, but the page will be broken at runtime.
